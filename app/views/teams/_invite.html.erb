Q: What’s in the Bike Commuter Challenge for me?
A: A chance to try something new and fun that could save me lots of money and stress!

Q: I live too far away, how could I bike 10, 20, or 50 miles?
A: Any bike trip to work counts – even partway. You can bike to the train, bus, or carpool location and
lock up there.

Q: Do I have to bike every day?
A: No, you only have to bike one time during Bike to Work Week, June 9-15, to be counted. Teams are
judged on participation percentage, so just one trip – even partway – counts as much as a coworker who
rides every day.

Q: I don’t have a bike.
A: What are you waiting for – get one! There are plenty of great deals out there, used or new! You don’t
need anything fancy, a cheap bike uses as much gas as an expensive one – none!

Q: My bike doesn’t work.
A: Get it in for a tune-up – most shops offer a basic (yet thorough) level of service for around $75-$100.

Q: I don’t know the first thing about biking to work!
A: Become an expert in no time! When you sign up at www.bikecommuterchallenge.org, be sure to
check out the How to Bike to Work page: it has everything you need to know about:

• Clothes
• Getting comfortable with traffic
• Safety
• Trip Planning
• Bikes on transit
• Parking/Locking


As you are now out of reasons not to join our Bike Commuter Challenge team, sign up today and let’s
start bike commuting!
