<h1>Bike Commuter Challenge 2012 has ended</h1>
<br>

<p><strong>We hope you enjoyed the site and the challenge this year, thanks for playing!</strong></p>
<br>

<p>Active Transportation Alliance will be moving the Commuter Challenge to a new platform starting this fall, so we have taken down the team and commute information.</p>
